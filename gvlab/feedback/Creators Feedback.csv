"2022/06/04 3:00:14 לפנה״צ GMT‎+3‎","In the beginning, it was fun trying to see the limits of where the AI guessing ability was. However, after a while, once you learn the quirks of the AI, it became a bit more boring because you know that the AI had issues with some specific words and those words were very obvious to normal people. Sometimes it was annoying to get a set of images and there's just nothing you can think of to link a few up. While sometimes challenging, it did get a bit frustrating when that happened and you felt you had to make a somewhat bad cue.","Fun;Challenge;Interest;Curiosity;Entertainment;Amusement;Competitive","5","3","4","5","4","3","4","","12","12 is definitely easier however I'm not sure if it's easier if you don't know a bit about the AI and it's quirks. If you know the quirks of the AI, it was very profitable to use words you know that the AI will mess up on. However, if you're not familiar with the quirks, it might not be that much easier because, you might end up trying to choose words that the AI knows and has an easier chance to guess at. ","2","I feel debatable between 2 and 3. 2 let's you make a ""tight"" cue which correspond to only two images however it can be risky if the AI knows the word. 3 can be safer because you can go a bit farther with your imagination and not risk a bad human selection and still fool the AI.","5","5","Sometimes the images you selected for my cue, I would take a second look at the image it selected to try to figure out why it did it that way. I would also take note of any obvious ""bad""  image selections it made based on the cue because that was how I learned about the quirks of the AI and how to exploit it.","The bonus did make me sometimes give up on making a ""good"" cue and make a ""performance"" cue. Performance cue being a cue that utilizes a quirk of the AI that I know and almost guarantee that it will get wrong and will generally be easy for humans to guess. But it's not a creative or interesting cue. Notable words are human, male and female or sometimes features like eyes, noses, ears, hands, etc. ","5","This would be a super interesting online if you include things like leaderboards for creators, categories, more images (although be sure to get rights to images!) and letting people rate the cues. I can definitely see game like this being popular with streamers on Twitch.tv to play with their audience (streamer https://twitch.tv/itshafu is pretty known to like games like these and sometimes streams her playing code names with other streamers) or with a group of people online."

"2022/06/04 3:52:29 לפנה״צ GMT‎+3‎","I liked that it was a very creative-focused task, even more so on the creator's side. It was fun to think of what I could come up with to link these words/images and fool the AI/other people. Even with the bonuses I don't think the pay was up to par for this one, and that I didn't like. This job is easy to do when solving and very hard when creating, it's very thought intensive.

Since I had to be really abstract in these associations, the links tended to be very slim in how many images I could really fit into any given answer.","4","4","It made me feel good when I fooled it and really bad when I did not.

It was harder to find a clear-cut word that only worked with 20% of the pictures but didn't ambiguously include 40-50% of the pictures, if that makes sense...","2","Two was almost always do-able, but when I really tried to make the word apply to 3, it sort of became impossible for me.
