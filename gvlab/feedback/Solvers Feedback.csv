"2022/06/04 2:16:29 לפנה״צ GMT‎+3‎","it was fun to do some light puzzle solving, but i felt the requirements for maintaining the qualification (i had mine revoked) penalized people who were trying to make a reasonable hourly rate off of it.  Several creators did sloppy work and left solutions open to interpretation or not clearly defined, and by not picking the solutions they rushed to select, my solve rate dipped below a threshold necessary to keep the qual.  All in all, a fun project but needed to pay a couple pennies more per HIT in order to make it worthwhile.","Fun;Interest;Entertainment;Amusement;Frustration","4","3","4","4","2","3","3","nope","3","3","5",""

"2022/06/04 2:43:26 לפנה״צ GMT‎+3‎","I feel that the cues fell into three categories: obvious, easy and confusing. Obvious are ones that would have cues for things like female, clothes or humans in which there are obvious images. Easy is similar but this falls into the category of say edible or werewolf that shows something you can easily associate. Easy but sometimes not immediately obvious. Confusing is when you get those really weird cues, either super stretching, a really obscure word in which you have to look up or just bad cues. The bad ones was really annoying to do and quite frustrating. I think obvious ones were okay but too many got tiresome. Easy was kind of fun and those are the ones that made it interesting. They weren't too hard to figure out but also not something you could immediately go click, click, click, submit.","Fun;Challenge;Interest;Creativity;Entertainment;Amusement;Annoyment;Frustration;Tiredness","5","4","4","5","3","3","4","","4","5","5","It was fun and I hope the best for this project! If you make an online game I would 100% suggest a leaderboard for ""creators"" for people to create the cues. Introduce categories so people can focus on specific things. If you're also so inclined, build something to work with Twitch.tv so streamers can play with their audience. There are some pictionary like games that do this where the streamer draws and the people in chat try to guess."

Next time you make a task like this I think you should resize the images so you aren't loading multiple 1000x1000 images that are just going to get scaled down into tiny boxes anyway.

But occasionally you'd get one where it was clear they weren't doing it correctly or there might have been an error, and those felt like they were wasting my time. And then there were the really difficult ones where you just couldn't figure out what they were trying to connect. Ones I had mixed feelings about were when you could see an additional item that you could associate with the others, and it was satisfying but frustrating because they didn't catch it.","Fun;Challenge;Interest;Curiosity;Annoyment;Frustration;Confusion;satisfaction","5","3","5","5","5","5","4","I can't think of any.","4","4","4","I have to say there were times where I thought maybe my thinking was too out of the box for some of the exercises and I wondered if anyone else would make that kind of association.
